Project from: https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Arithmetic/Integer
Task
Get two integers from the user,   and then (for those two integers), display their:

  sum
  difference
  product
  integer quotient
  remainder
  exponentiation   (if the operator exists)

Don't include error handling.

For quotient, indicate how it rounds   (e.g. towards zero, towards negative infinity, etc.).

For remainder, indicate whether its sign matches the sign of the first operand or of the second operand, if they are different.

Bonus: Include an example of the integer `divmod` operator. For example: as in #Haskell, #Python and #ALGOL 68
